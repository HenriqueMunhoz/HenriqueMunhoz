**ABOUT MY JOURNEY**
<div align="justify">
 
I have started my journey in the developer world in the the ending beggining of 2017. My focus in the start of my career was to find out where in the vast world of development I would fit in best, so i have study front-end technologies like JS, HTML, CSS, Vue.JS, React, MaterializeCSS, Bootstrap and many others to really know that Front-end to know this wasn't my thing ðŸ¤­, but i can handle myself ~~very well~~, after front-end i jumped to learn about Ruby on Rails, that is my main progamming language today, using inicialy in monolite projects and then i was curious about DevOps world, how to use AWS server, how servers works?, what CI/CD means, learning about Docker and Docker-Compose, NGINX. Well, like i said in the beggning i was experiencing i little of everything, so i started to work as Scrum Master that i have lead a team with 4 developers using scrum ceremonies ( Dailys, Plannings, Reviews, Reviews ), kanban, agile methodology/environment, to then only, and only then know that my place was at the back-end ***CODE EVERYWHERE ðŸ‘¾*** that is where my love is, coding is what makes my feels happy about me choose of developer career, every new chalange is amazing.
